This is a grasshopper script designed to take a brep and produce cutting breps (breps which will be used in a BooleanDifference operation with the selected brep). These cutters are designed to assist with adding stress relief for the first feew initials layers of a large flat 3d print. Thermal shrinkage often causes large flat based 3d prints to warp away from the build plate. This script aims to provide an automated way to model feautres into your brep, to alleviate these thermal stresses.
